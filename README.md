Feedly is a great service and has completely filled the void left by Googles shutdown of Reader. 
One feature that has been missing is an open-in-background tab.  This is because of how Firefox
protects the user from unwanted pop-ups.  

To get around this, GreaseMonkey is used to modify the default behavior.  This script is used
to open articles in a background tab, allowing the user to skim through the stories and have the
fully loaded article when they are opened in the background.

This script was modified from the version at  https://gist.github.com/axemclion/d3b876de5e0ba4eab7dc
which was created by axemclion.  All props go to him.
